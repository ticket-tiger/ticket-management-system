## General Info

Has your enterprise just released a new product?  Would you like to hear feedback from your users to ensure they have a smooth experience?  If you answered yes to these questions, then our Ticket Management System is the perfect product for you.  Ticket Management System (or TMS) is a cloud-based issue tracking application where users can communicate any bugs they found using your product.  Our user interface records an issue's title, category, and description which gives your company valuable information to resolve the bug as quickly as possible.  

Users can create accounts to create new tickets and view their existing ones, however creating an account is not required to submit a ticket.  Instead, the user just records their email address so you have a way of reaching them.  

Your employees can login to view created tickets and edit them.  As the user's issue gets resolved, employees can update a ticket's status to reflect this.  Currently, the available status values are: 'Submitted', 'In Progress', and 'Resolved'.  Each time a ticket's status gets updated, the user will receive an email notification.  In addition to updating the status, employees should update a ticket's urgency and priority fields.  These fields allow your team to determine which issues should be tackled first.  By default, the urgency and priority of each ticket is 'Low'.  The available values for these fields are 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High'.  

Managers have all employee privileges in addition to the unique privileges of creating employees and deleting tickets.  Since they can serve as valuable information for an enterprise, we only recommend deleting tickets that were mistakenly created or contain inappropriate content.  

When a manager creates an employee, they will receive an email with a one-time password that expires in 7 days.  On their first login to TMS, an employee will need to create a permanent one.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
